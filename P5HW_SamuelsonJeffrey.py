'''
    Tried this a number of ways without while true and couldn't make it work as intended. a normal for loop
    would have worked but then I would have determined the laps instead of getting a lap number.
    I also needed the main to run until end game was chosen. So even after a race you can race again, add a car
    and race again or end. I worked on this for many hours trying different game types before I landed here
    just trying to satisfy the conditions created.
